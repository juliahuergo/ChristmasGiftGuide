		<div>
			<h2>When to start shopping</h2>
			<p>It is never too early to be prepared for the game ahead. As one would say: "Go big or go home!". When it comes to Christmas shopping, it really depends on your geographics and the people that surround when it is appropiate to start planning your gift situation. You don't want to start wrapping gifts in June, or the night before. Taking this into consideration, I personally recommend to start browsing for gift ideas toward the end of the Thanksgiving break, passing through the Black Friday sales (good time to shop!), and starting with December. I like to brain storm the ideas I have for each family member, friend, lover, work associate... I'm pleasurimg with my holiday spirit in a good ol' Excel spreadsheet, but a notepad would work too. Having a table drawn out with who I'm gifting, what I'm giving, when I have to buy it, etc. just makes my life so m,uch easier! That way I never get confused or, more importantly, leave anyone behind!

			<h2>The art of knowing who to gift</h2>
			<p>This segment may look straight-forward to some and quite absurdly included in my article. Offended as ever, I consider that evaluating who it is appropiate to give gifts to and what to spent on them is crucial during the Christmas season. Overfilled with joy, we may encounter ourselves driven by that feeling of generosity that appears to be floating in the air during this time of year and end up overspending. A way to avoid this is to know who really deserves a present and what that present should be. Analysing how close you are to a person is fundamental; in such way, your closest friends would most surely get a gift, while a person you're fond of you but nos necessarily great friends with, doesn't need a celebratory present coming your way. In fact, this might be counter-productive seeing as some people may feel like their friendship is trying to be bought and feel pressured. This applies as well to over-gifting, giving more than you will receive sounds charitable, but when happening with a friend or family member, you'll feel pretty disrespected or unloved, for this reason I feel it's best to discreetly get to a common price range to avoid misteps.</p>

			<h2>How to keep tabs (and keep the secret!)</h2>
			<p>If you're lucky you won't have to return or change anything, however, in most cases, a size will be wrong, somebody will be unhappy with their gift or may already have it, it is esential you know wherer you got every last gift and what to do in case of needing to change or return it. For this reason, I recommend keeping track of each return policy in the initial table from the "When to start shopping" section, which you should have already created. This way,. everything will be neatly organised in case of needing this information.</p>
